## 🧠 What Is a Discord Token?

Your **Discord token** is a secret identifier used by the app to authenticate you. With it, a script or client can act on your behalf.

> This is essentially your **Discord password in token form**. Never share it.

## ✅ Method: Use Browser or Desktop Console (2025 Working Version)

This method works on the **Discord Desktop App** and **Web Browser App** if not patched.

### 📌 Steps:

1. Open the Discord app or go to [https://discord.com/app](https://discord.com/app) in your browser.

2. Press:
   - `Ctrl + Shift + I` (on Windows)
   - `Cmd + Option + I` (on macOS)  
   This opens the **Developer Tools** window.

3. Go to the **Console** tab.

4. Paste and run the following code:

   ```js
   let token;
   webpackChunkdiscord_app.push([
     [Math.random()],
     {},
     (r) => {
       for (let m of Object.values(r.c)) {
         try {
           if (m?.exports?.default?.getToken !== undefined) {
             token = m.exports.default.getToken();
             break;
           }
         } catch (e) {}
       }
     }
   ]);
   token;
